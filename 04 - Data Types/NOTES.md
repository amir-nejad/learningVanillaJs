# Data Types

Each programming language, according to its capabilities, has specific data types, including numbers, characters, logical values, etc.

# Statically-typed vs. Dynamically-typed Programming Languages (Strongly-typed vs. Loosly-typed)

**Statically-typed** programming languages in this definition are languages that we must specify their data type when defining a variable. But **Dynamically-typed** languages are languages we do not need to set their data type when defining a variable.

C, C++, C#, and Java are Statically-typed.
Python, Perl, Ruby, PHP, and JavaScript are Dynamically-typed.

## C# example:

`string firstName = "Amirhossein";`

## JavaScript example:

`let firstName = "Amirhossein";`

# Strongly-typed vs. Weakly-typed Programming Languages

In **Strongly-typed** programming languages, the data type of a variable will not automatically be converted to another data type (Like Python). But in **Weakly-typed** programming languages, the variable's data type will automatically be converted to another (Like JavaScript).
