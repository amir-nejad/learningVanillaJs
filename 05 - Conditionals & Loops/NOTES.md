# Conditionals & Loops

## Conditionals
In programming, we use conditionals to logically check whether a condition is true or false. If it is true or not, a specific event will occur.

### JavaScript Conditional Statements
- if/else
- switch

### JavaScript Logical Operators
- && (and)
- || (or)
- !  (not)

### JavaScript Comparison Operators
- ==  (Equal to)
- === (Equal value and equal type)
- !=  (Not equal)
- !== (Not equal value or not equal type)
- >   (Greater than)
- <   (Less than)
- >=  (Greater than or equal to)
- <=  (Less than or equal to)
- ?   (Ternary operator)


## Loops

Loops in programming are used to execute a set of instructions multiple times in a specific condition.

### Loop Types in JavaScript
- for
- for/in
- for/of
- while
- do/while
