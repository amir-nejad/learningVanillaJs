# Variables & Operators

## Variable Definition

In programming, variables are a structure for temporarily holding specific data that stored value can change based on conditions.

The reason for using variables is that they can be defined once and used in other parts of the code. It prevents the multiple definitions of the same data and the occurrence of human error.


## Constant Definition

Constants have the same structure as variables and are used to store specific data, except that the value of constants is defined only once and cannot be changed.


## Operator Definition
Operators came from mathematics to programming to perform specific mathematical operations. Just as we use "x" to represent multiplication in math, we can have an equivalent in programming.
